Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tlotlo Motingwe and I am a self-taught programmer. I know Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaSript. 

I got into programming because I wanted to create wonderful things for the world, and I believe knowing how to 
code is akin to having a superpower.

I'm currently working on a startup with my friend. We are building a social events app, designed with the purpose
of connecting people and fostering new and meaningful relationships through the power of events.

How to reach me: 
My email: motingwetlotlo@yahoo.com


Fun Fact: I am a guitar player and martial artist. I am currently learning the Russian language.
